<h1>Project 3 Proposal! Yay! Woo!</h1>

<p>Simple budget maker! I'm going to make a simple budget maker! The idea is to have a simple way to calculate income/expenses. You just write a description, sort it into either income or expense, and then it'll calculate your net income/loss. Think of it as one of those old calculators that have the little roll of paper my parents used to balance their checkbook. Oh good idea, I'll also make it serve as a checkbook balancer!</p><br>
