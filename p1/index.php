	<h1>About Justin</h1>

	<p>Hi Everyone, I'm Justin! I'm 20 and I live in Porter Square in Cambridge. I hope to pursue web development/design as a career, so I really look forward to this class. For me, web development represents the perfect blend of nerdy programming and artistic design, and being able to have a career creating web pages is an exciting prospect!</p>
	<p>I am using asmallorange's small hosting plan, and they also host my domain name. For code editing I use both Notepad++ and Dreamweaver (I know, I know, but it's really helpful sometimes).</p>
	<p>And here's a link to my Git repo: <a href="https://github.com/justintseko/dwa">https://github.com/justintseko/dwa</a></p>
